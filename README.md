# Diet-Planner-Application
The following repository consists of the code to build a simple diet planner application using java server pages and using MySql as the database.
There are four files in the repository page1.jsp, page2.jsp, page3.jsp, page4.jsp.
page1.jsp is the login page where the user is asked some important details such as name, height, width, gender, age. In the next page2.jap his details are collected and inserted into the database. Accordingly his BMI is calculated. 
The BMI from the page2.jsp is passed to next page3.jsp where a diet is planned for the calculated BMI.
In page3.jsp the user can select the particular items and the application will calculate the users total intake and amount of calories he consumes through his diet.
